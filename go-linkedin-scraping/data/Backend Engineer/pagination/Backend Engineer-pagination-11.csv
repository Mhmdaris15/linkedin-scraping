WHY BRIK???

Let‚Äôs be honest: When you read ‚Äúconstruction‚Äù or ‚Äúcement‚Äù or ‚Äúbuilding materials‚Äù, your first thoughts might be ‚Äúdusty, slow, uninspiring‚Äù.

Nothing could be further from the truth. We pride ourselves on being among the fastest companies in the world with the best business sense. You might not believe this right away ‚Äì we usually don‚Äôt talk a lot about ourselves.

What‚Äôs true: we don‚Äôt build autonomous cars. We don‚Äôt build landing rockets. We don‚Äôt build blockchains and ICO them.

But what we do is we disrupt one of the last undisrupted industries: Construction. Construction is one of 3 industries responsible for 88% of all inflation since the year 2000. It is one of the most inefficient industries in the world. It is just beginning its digital journey.

That means: it is one of the last Eldorados to build exponential new businesses.

Our ambition is to fundamentally change how construction works, starting from building materials. We are serious about this ‚Äì no PR nonsense, no pseudo-disruption, no-Entrepreneur wannabe that pretends to do innovation. We disrupt construction with force and pure financial motivation. And: we are among the world‚Äôs most entrepreneurial companies (yes, we are!). That puts us in the best position to completely transform the construction industry. In just a few years, we want to be South East Asia‚Äôs most reputed corporate in disruptive business models in the fields of construction.
