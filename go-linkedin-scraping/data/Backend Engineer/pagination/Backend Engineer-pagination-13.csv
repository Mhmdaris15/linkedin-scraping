ùëµùíêùíïùíÜ: Crossover jobs are are fully compliant with LinkedIn's policies, as well as the applicable laws in every country where we advertise.

Allow us to clarify some common misconceptions:
1) The reason we post so many job ads is because LinkedIn organizes all job postings by location. So, the only way to reach candidates all over the world is to post multiple ads in every city you want to hire from. Most recruiters don't bother because it's too time consuming... but we're not most recruiters.
2) We mostly recruit independent contractors, not employees, because labor laws vary so much from one country to another that it's near-impossible to recruit globally otherwise (which is why it's still uncommon even though most jobs can now be done remotely).
3) As is standard for any self-employed person, the stated pay is the entire compensation package. Because they are not employees, each contractor is responsible for handling the things that an employer would take care of e.g. taxes, equipment, vacation time, health insurance. One of the major reasons that Crossover jobs pay so much more than local jobs is to overcompensate for these costs.

It's hard, but it's worth it!
