Get to Know Our Team

In Agoda’s Back End Engineering department, we build the scalable, fault-tolerant systems and APIs that host our core business logic. Our systems cover all major areas of our business: inventory and pricing, product information, customer data, communications, partner data, booking systems, payments, FinTech and more. These mission-critical systems change frequently with dozens of releases per day, so we must employ state-of-the-art CI/CD and testing techniques in order to make sure everything works without any downtime. We also ensure that our systems are self-healing, responding gracefully to extreme loads or unexpected input. In order to accomplish this, we use state-of-the-art languages like Scala and Go, data technologies like Kafka and Spark, and agile development practices. Most importantly though, we hire great people from all around the world and empower them to be successful. Whether it’s building new projects like Flights and Packages or reimagining our existing business, you’ll make a big impact as part of the Back End Engineering team.

We’d love to hear from you if you are skilled in any of the technologies we work with (note – we are not looking for you to have them all). We are interested in speaking to persons of any level from individuals just starting their IT careers to experts in their field, although this particular position is better suitable to veteran engineers, with expertise in certain technologies, and especially those that had lead projects, initiatives and/or teams.

Design, develop and maintain platforms across the back end area
Improve scalability, stability, and efficiency of our existing systems
Write great code and help others write great code
Collaborate with other teams and departments

Excellent verbal and written English communication skills

It’s Great If You Have

Experience with Scrum/Agile development methodologies

𝑵𝒐𝒕𝒆: Crossover jobs are are fully compliant with LinkedIn's policies, as well as the applicable laws in every country where we advertise.

Allow us to clarify some common misconceptions:
1) The reason we post so many job ads is because LinkedIn organizes all job postings by location. So, the only way to reach candidates all over the world is to post multiple ads in every city you want to hire from. Most recruiters don't bother because it's too time consuming... but we're not most recruiters.
2) We mostly recruit independent contractors, not employees, because labor laws vary so much from one country to another that it's near-impossible to recruit globally otherwise (which is why it's still uncommon even though most jobs can now be done remotely).
3) As is standard for any self-employed person, the stated pay is the entire compensation package. Because they are not employees, each contractor is responsible for handling the things that an employer would take care of e.g. taxes, equipment, vacation time, health insurance. One of the major reasons that Crossover jobs pay so much more than local jobs is to overcompensate for these costs.
