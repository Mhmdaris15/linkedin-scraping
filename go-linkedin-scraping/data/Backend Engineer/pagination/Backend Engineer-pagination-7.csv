Our systems cover all major areas of our business: inventory and pricing, product information, customer data, communications, partner data, booking systems, payments, FinTech and more. These mission-critical systems change frequently with dozens of releases per day, so we must employ state-of-the-art CI/CD and testing techniques in order to make sure everything works without any downtime. We also ensure that our systems are self-healing, responding gracefully to extreme loads or unexpected input. In order to accomplish this, we use state-of-the-art languages like Scala and Go, data technologies like Kafka and Spark, and agile development practices.

About Vida

What are we trying to solve?

We have 7.5 billion people on Earth, of which over 1 billion cannot securely prove their identity right now.

Every year, 140 million babies are born, of which 40 million go unregistered.

Simply put, these people are deprived of social benefits, such as education and health, their civil rights to vote and travel; and are excluded from the economy because they cannot sign up for bank accounts, loans, welfare programs etc. We believe this is unacceptable, and needs to change.

At VIDA , We are creating a frictionless digital identity system. One that fulfills the needs and expectations of our times, and is available anywhere, for everyone.

Why are we solving this problem? 

The United Nations (UN) and World Bank ID4D initiatives aim to provide everyone on the planet with a legal identity by 2030. This deadline is just 9 years away, we are expecting a digital identity to be a legal human right by then and we at VIDA want to be pioneers in leading this change.

Who are we? 

We are a highly driven bunch of people to solve this problem for our own reasons. Whether it is to solve for misleading doctors, or because we didn’t get access to fair ration due to corruption - Our collective goal aligns.

Other things that we care about:

Our mission is to enable trust, so what we do is pretty serious stuff – we work hard and we have audacious goals. We balance it through humor and making sure we have fun at work. We take our work seriously, but we don’t take ourselves too seriously.
We are a startup so at times we will do things that are outside our scope. We do it to learn but we also do it because it takes a village.
We believe feedback is a gift and should be given freely, constructively, and in a respectful manner.
We are accountable to many stakeholders, but first and foremost, we are accountable to our mission and each other"

~~~
𝑵𝒐𝒕𝒆: Crossover jobs are are fully compliant with LinkedIn's policies, as well as the applicable laws in every country where we advertise.

Allow us to clarify some common misconceptions:
1) The reason we post so many job ads is because LinkedIn organizes all job postings by location. So, the only way to reach candidates all over the world is to post multiple ads in every city you want to hire from. Most recruiters don't bother because it's too time consuming... but we're not most recruiters.
2) We mostly recruit independent contractors, not employees, because labor laws vary so much from one country to another that it's near-impossible to recruit globally otherwise (which is why it's still uncommon even though most jobs can now be done remotely).
3) As is standard for any self-employed person, the stated pay is the entire compensation package. Because they are not employees, each contractor is responsible for handling the things that an employer would take care of e.g. taxes, equipment, vacation time, health insurance. One of the major reasons that Crossover jobs pay so much more than local jobs is to overcompensate for these costs.

It's hard, but it's worth it!
