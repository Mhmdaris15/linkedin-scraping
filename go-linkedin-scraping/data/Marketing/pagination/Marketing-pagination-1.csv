Position Summary

We offer guests an experience that is memorable and unique; one that travels with them through the entire guest journey. From their initial interactions with us on social media channels through their time in our hotel and bar, you will help our guests truly experience what our brand is all about. As a Social Media & Event Activator, you will use your knowledge of the local market and influencers to connect with our guests on social channels to create hotel and brand awareness, grow reach, and drive engagement. When not building buzz on social media, you will serve as a seamless point of contact for guests hosting events in the hotel. Through your flawless event execution, you will give guests confidence in our brand’s ability to remove the friction from event planning and delivery. Using creative content, online conversations, relevant partnerships, and well-executed events, you will play host to guests in two of the most important places where they spend time with us: in the hotel and online.

No matter what position you are in, there are a few things that are critical to success – creating a safe work place, following company policies and procedures, upholding quality standards, and ensuring your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Social Media & Event Activators will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time) and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 25 pounds without assistance). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Social Media & Event Activators – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.
