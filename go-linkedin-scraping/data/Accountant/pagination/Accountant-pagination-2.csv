By providing a daily dosage of vitamins and minerals, we aim to unlock the potential of 200 million millennials across Southeast Asia. We are revolutionizing the vitamin category by making quality vitamin products in innovative formats accessible to urban millennials. Our first line of vitamin gummies took the Indonesian market by storm, propelling YOUVIT to become the country’s #1 gummy vitamin brand. We now plan to build on that initial success and expand our product range into new formats, build out the brand, double down on our unique omnichannel distribution model and expand further across Southeast Asia.

Preventative health and vitamins are top of mind across emerging markets. The ASEAN supplements market size is expected to reach US$ 10.6 billion by 2026, fueled by increasing health consciousness among the urban population. The pandemic accelerated a lifestyle change towards preventative health and millennials are often at the forefront of this shift. According to a report by Inventure Knowledge, 52% of Indonesians are consuming more vitamins since the pandemic. Furthermore, lock-downs and movement control measures have triggered a rapid shift towards online and direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales channels.

The majority of local brands are still marketing traditional remedies or low-end vitamins that are often positioned as cures instead of preventative supplements. High-quality nutraceutical supplements by global brands are expensive, the category sees almost no innovation and all players follow a traditional retail focused play book.

YOUVIT is a new generation brand that is uniquely positioned to leverage the changes happening in the market. After launching our first products in 2017, we quickly became the product of choice for millions of urban millennials, 70% of which are female.","Responsibilities
