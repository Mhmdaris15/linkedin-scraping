RMI is an independent nonprofit founded in 1982 transforming the global energy system to secure a clean, prosperous, zero-carbon future for all. It engages businesses, communities, institutions, and entrepreneurs to accelerate the adoption of market-based solutions that cost-effectively shift from fossil fuels to efficiency and renewable.

With an independent, objective, and fact-based approach, RMI’s SEA Energy Program, working within the umbrella Global South Program, brings experience gained from engagements with regional governments, utilities, corporations, financial institutions, project developers, technology companies, and industry experts to solve the toughest energy challenges.
