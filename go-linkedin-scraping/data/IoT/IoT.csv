A major revamp of an organization's IT backbone, IT modernization helps businesses stay competitive in today's constantly shifting digital landscape.

By embracing modern IT tools and technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud-based infrastructures, businesses undergo a digital transformation, enhancing efficiency, reducing expenses and strengthening their security posture.

IT modernization affects many different components of the digital ecosystem, which includes everything from network resources to end-user hardware and storage systems.

It can involve embracing cloud computing and a cloud-first mindset. For example, migrating on-premises servers to a cloud-based model -- where a third party hosts a significant portion of the hardware and software -- enables businesses to consume resources on an as-needed basis.
