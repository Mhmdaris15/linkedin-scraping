Direct and mentor diverse teams, such as customers, partners, and colleagues in technical delivery aspects, as well as non-technical topics such as communication strategies or executive influence.
Fuel our internal growth by identifying, leading or contributing to internal pivotal initiatives, such as innovations, building up a strategic brand, and nurture teammates' skills by sharing knowledge.
Where required, support pre-sales activities to position Salesforce Services.
Contribute to broader goals by becoming a citizen philanthropist and give back to our communities by joining or leading volunteering activities.

Hands-on technical consulting and solution implementation experience for a major software domain (e.g. CRM, ERP, HR) as well as coding experience in object oriented languages.
Ability to analyze, design, and optimize business processes via technology and integration.
Experience in guiding customers and project members in rationalising and deploying emerging technology for business use cases.
Work independently and as part of a distributed team and a willingness to take ownership of problems.
Rapidly learn new technologies as well as strong presentation, communication and facilitation skills.
Available to travel regionally and occasionally internationally depending on customer needs.
Experience will be evaluated based on alignment to the core competencies for the role (e.g. extracurricular leadership roles, military experience, volunteer work, etc.).

Preferred Qualifications

A detailed understanding of Web Services, Data Modeling, and Enterprise application integration concepts, including experience with enterprise integration tools (ESBs and/or ETL tools), and common integration design patterns with enterprise systems (e.g. CMS, ERP, HRIS, DWH/DM).

Experience as a Senior Architect and/or CTO in a mid to large sized organisation with leadership driving an organisational transformation in a matrixed organisation.

Berbeda dengan PHR, PHD menawarkan pelayanan yang berfokus pada pesan antar (delivery) dan pesan bawa (take away). Lebih dari 200 outlet PHD sudah tersebar hampir di seluruh wilayah Indonesia, menjadi solusi bagi masyarakat sekarang yang umumnya terkendala dengan kemacetan, kesibukan di kantor atau sekedar menginginkan kebersamaan dengan keluarga di rumah.

Seiring dengan perkembangan perusahaan, pada Oktober 2015 The Kitchen by Pizza Hut (KPH) hadir melengkapi 2 brand yang sudah ada sebelumnya. Dengan konsep eat-in yang menawarkan suasana santap di restoran yang berbeda, KPH menawarkan pilihan kepada pelanggan untuk dapat memesan pizza per loyang atau per potong.

Tidak berhenti pada brand KPH, bulan Januari 2018 hadir Pizza Hut Express (PHE) dengan konsep fast casual dine-in, dimana pelanggan dapat menghampiri counter saat memesan dan mengambil pesanannya untuk dibawa ke meja atau dibawa pulang. Menu yang simple membuat PHE menjadi pilihan bagi pelanggan di pusat perbelanjaan yang menginginkan produk lezat namun cepat penyajiannya.

Semua brand PT. Sarimelati Kencana Tbk. hadir melayani seluruh masyarakat Indonesia dan kami senang menjadi bagian dari keluarga Anda.
