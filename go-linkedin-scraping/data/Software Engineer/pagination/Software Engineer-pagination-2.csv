As an applied research lab with an integrated game studio/publisher, we are uniquely positioned to lead the way. We build our own games that are native to our infrastructure. This allows us to fully understand and utilize the capabilities of our platform, resulting in novel game designs built around the platform's unique power and quirks.

Backed by the best

We recently raised $10 million in seed funding led by Haun Ventures with participation from angels in tech and gaming such as Elad Gil, Balaji Srinivasan, Kevin Aluwi, Siqi Chen, etc.
