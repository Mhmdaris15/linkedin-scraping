Agoda is an online travel booking platform for accommodations, flights, and more. We build and deploy cutting-edge technology that connects travelers with more than 3.6 million accommodations globally. Based in Asia and part of Booking Holdings, our 6,000+ employees representing 90+ nationalities foster a work environment rich in diversity, creativity, and collaboration. We innovate through a culture of experimentation and ownership, enhancing the ability for our customers to experience the world.

Get to Know Our Team

In Agoda’s Back End Engineering department, we build the scalable, fault-tolerant systems and APIs that host our core business logic. Our systems cover all major areas of our business: inventory and pricing, product information, customer data, communications, partner data, booking systems, payments, FinTech and more. These mission-critical systems change frequently with dozens of releases per day, so we must employ state-of-the-art CI/CD and testing techniques in order to make sure everything works without any downtime. We also ensure that our systems are self-healing, responding gracefully to extreme loads or unexpected input. In order to accomplish this, we use state-of-the-art languages like Scala and Go, data technologies like Kafka and Spark, and agile development practices. Most importantly though, we hire great people from all around the world and empower them to be successful. Whether it’s building new projects like Flights and Packages or reimagining our existing business, you’ll make a big impact as part of the Back End Engineering team.

The Opportunity

You might call yourself “full stack” or “back end” or you might consider yourself an authority in a certain field, but you have a keen interest in how the different systems work together.

We’d love to hear from you if you are skilled in any of the technologies we work with (note – we are not looking for you to have them all). We are interested in speaking to persons of any level from individuals just starting their IT careers to experts in their field, although this particular position is better suitable to veteran engineers, with expertise in certain technologies, and especially those that had lead projects, initiatives and/or teams.

In This Role, You’ll Get to

Think and own the full life cycle of our products, not just a single piece of code – from business requirements, technology selection, coding standards, agile development, unit and application testing, to CI/CD and proper monitoring
Design, develop and maintain platforms across the back end area
Improve scalability, stability, and efficiency of our existing systems
Write great code and help others write great code
Collaborate with other teams and departments

What You’ll Need To Succeed

7+ years’ experience under your belt developing performance-critical applications that run in a production environment using Scala, Java or C#
Experience in leading projects, initiatives and/or teams, with full ownership of the systems involved
Data platforms like SQL, Cassandra or Hadoop. You understand that different applications have different data requirements
Good understanding of algorithms and data structures
Strong coding ability
You are passionate about the craft of software development and constantly work to improve your knowledge and skills
Excellent verbal and written English communication skills

It’s Great If You Have

Experience with Scrum/Agile development methodologies
Experience building large-scale distributed products
Core engineering infrastructure tools like Git for source control, TeamCity for Continuous Integration and Puppet for deployment
Hands-on experience working with technology like queueing systems (Kafka, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, MSMQ), Spark, Hadoop, NoSQL (Cassandra, MongoDB), Play framework, Akka library
