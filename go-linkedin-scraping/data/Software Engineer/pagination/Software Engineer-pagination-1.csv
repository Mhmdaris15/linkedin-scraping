Unlike the latter, mass transit services can serve at least 30x more passengers with lesser vehicles, which also means less congestion and smogs generated amongst our roads. A large network of free-flowing mass transit vehicles means that any corner of a city can be made infinitely accessible and every citizen can now easily access public transportation. The key to making this work is to ensure that every passenger can now share a speedy mass transit ride that caters to their personal schedule- this is the goal of RushOwl. A mass transit ride that can adapt dynamically to every passengers’ demands in terms of location and time creates an era where no new cities (even in new planets) will plan public transportation starting with bus or train stations ever again.
