It’s our job to ensure that our Transport services run seamlessly from the inside out.

You get to work with an insanely driven and proud team of engineers who deliver fundamental functionality to enable multiple products within Gojek Mobility organization dealing with scenarios at a really interesting combination of scale and complexity. We are at the heart of mobility engineering R&D - at one hand the team takes big bets that can entirely change the way the rest of the engineering team does product development; on the other hand you are also responsible and get to get your hands dirty on the foundational infrastructure layer where we manage our own GKE and IaaC setup for rest of the Transport engineering teams.

Though working from home has been a significant change, it hasn’t made work boring - in fact, we’ve been enjoying this new work setup more than we expected! When we aren’t busy working, you’d probably find us playing online games like Among Us and Sketchful, or catching up with each other on our virtual hangouts. We work as a team to get our job done well, and genuinely enjoy each other's company.
