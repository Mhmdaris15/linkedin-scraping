The Data department oversees all of Agoda’s data-related requirements. Our ultimate goal is to enable and increase the use of data in the company through creative approaches and the implementation of powerful resources such as operational and analytical databases, queue systems, BI tools, and data science technology. We hire the brightest minds from around the world to take on this challenge and equip them with the knowledge and tools that contribute to their personal growth and success while supporting our company’s culture of diversity and experimentation. The role the Data team plays at Agoda is critical as business users, product managers, engineers, and many others rely on us to empower their decision making. We are equally dedicated to our customers by improving their search experience with faster results and protecting them from any fraudulent activities. Data is interesting only when you have enough of it, and we have plenty. This is what drives up the challenge as part of the Data department, but also the reward.

The Opportunity:

We think of Data Science in Agoda differently. For us, a data scientist is a fusion of core production skills with analytic and business skills. We’ve brought top talents from (literally) all over the world who focus relentlessly on building products which utilize ML and AI as their main edge.

Work on tough problems. Can we detect causation between metrics and bookings? How can automatically answer our users’ questions? How do we tune our AB testing platform to ensure we aren’t optimizing noise? How do we measure experiment success to properly trade off type I and II errors? What is the ideal caching strategy for prices and how do build an ML model to implement it? How can you detect anomalies within more than one million time-series that we track daily? Can you separate between bots and human traffic? Can you make our across-data-centers replication into smart replication using ML models? These are just a few of the diverse questions we tackle and some which you will lead your team to crack. You will be impacting every aspect of the business and it will require various techniques, from diving deep into data with SQL and Big Data tools, all the way to deploying modern machine learning models.

Deliver results. Work directly with the heads of the business departments and the product management team. Influence them with compelling product ideas based on data insights that can move the dial on our business.

In this Role, you’ll get to: 

Balance quantitative data analyses with qualitative user insights to uncover how our users book travel to drive new and existing product impact
Build, validate, test, and deploy machine learning or other data science models to predict and influence the behavior of consumers with the goal of optimizing products & processes
Test and validate insights via rapid experimentation and deployment
Interface with business/operation teams and key stakeholders at all levels to formulate solutions & product changes informed by your findings
Leverage data to help the business answer questions around further expansion, products, process optimization, cost optimization, customer acquisition/retention/churn and any other business goals that can be addressed through data insights
Form strong, cross-functional relationships with designers, product managers, software developers, and marketers who build, design, and optimize our technology and tools
